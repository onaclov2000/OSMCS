Ultimately from what I've understood from the MIT lectures, there are 5 steps to really solving a DP.

1. Figure out how many sub problems there are
2. Guess how to solve the sub problems.
3. Relate the subproblems to solutions
4. Find a recursive algorithm which solves the sub problems
5. Solve the original problem.

Sub problems typically break down into 3 variations.

prefix which means it makes sense to start from the beginning of the 'list' and work forwards (correct?)
   so for this case doing fibbonacci it doesn't make sense to start with the nth value and work backwards because
   you don't know n, you don't know n-1... you know 0, so start with 0. (I think this makes sense?)
   
suffix which means it makes sense to start from the end of the 'list' and work backwards (correct?)
   sometimes the later values need to be considered
