For those of you who haven't used proctortrack before go to the following link.

I logged in via my gt email address, though its not through my GT password (so I'm not sure how that works, but it's been a while since i signed up, it might be that you create an account with your GT address and make a new password, so mileage may vary).
 
In there a practice exam by Dr. Joyner should be listed (along with our class). I recommend you follow Dr. Joyners practice test (you can take it as often as you want, so don't worry about it disappearing).
 
This will install the proctortrack software as part of the steps, and confirm your webcam and whatnot is working.
 
Once installed Proctortrack records your desktop, audio and video from the webcam. Therefore, I would recommend showing your scratch paper is blank before starting the test (I have forgotten to do this in the past and had no issues, but better safe than sorry). I also personally recommend if you have a spare computer you don't mind re-formatting or ONLY using for exams this is a good idea, but that's just my paranoia speaking :)
 
Good lighting is recommended, I have setup a desk lamp to face me so I have good lighting (and they say keep a plain background so I have setup  a bedsheet hanging behind me typically too).
 
When I show my ID the text is mostly readable but it's definately not perfect clarity, so as long as you can make out the letters I think you'll be fine. Also it's odd the hand they have you put your knuckles in is really weird shaped, just make sure your knuckles are visible and somewhat clear (I think this is simliar to your fingerprints as they are a unique identifier).
 
Once the exam starts you need to make sure you stay at your desk and try not to move around a ton otherwise it's likely your exam will get flagged. 
 
FLAGGED DOES NOT MEAN YOU AUTOMATICALLY ARE FAILED (I believe). I believe it is an opportunity for the Professor/TA's and/or Proctortrack itself to review the video and determine if there is any questionable behavior. (I could be wrong so TA's/Professor please correct if I am).
 
 
GOOD LUCK!!!
 
 
EDIT: If you have any issues try to get on with Proctortrack Helpdesk/chat immediately (another student who I have spoken to just a few moments ago is having problems creating an account).
